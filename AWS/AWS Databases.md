## How does Aurora achieve high performance?

- Distributed, fault-tolerant, SSD-based storage layer decoupled from compute
- Six-way replication across 3 Availability Zones for durability and fast reads
- Parallel query processing and pushdown optimizations
- Write forwarding to storage layer reduces commit latency
- Backtrack feature allows rewinding without restore overhead
- Auto-scaling read replicas to distribute read load

---

## What are DynamoDB Streams and their use?

- **DynamoDB Streams** capture a time-ordered sequence of item-level changes (insert, modify, remove) in a table.
- Allows near real-time processing of changes.
- Use cases:
  - Trigger AWS Lambda functions for event-driven architectures.
  - Replicate changes across regions.
  - Maintain materialized views or caches.
  - Audit and data analytics pipelines.

---

## How to cache RDS queries using ElastiCache?

1. **Choose a caching engine**: Redis (more features) or Memcached (simple cache).  
2. **Implement caching logic in your application**:  
   - On query request, check cache for result.  
   - If cache miss, query RDS, then store result in cache with TTL.  
3. **Use cache invalidation strategies**:  
   - Time-based expiration (TTL).  
   - Manual invalidation on data changes via app logic or DB triggers.  
4. **Optional**: Use ElastiCache clusters with replication and sharding for scalability.

## Redshift vs RDS ‚Äì when to use each?

| Aspect                  | Redshift                             | RDS                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Purpose                 | Data warehousing and analytics      | Online transaction processing (OLTP) |
| Data Volume             | Petabyte-scale                      | Gigabyte to terabyte scale          |
| Query Type              | Complex analytical queries          | CRUD, OLTP, transactional queries   |
| Storage Model           | Columnar storage                    | Row-based storage                   |
| Performance Optimized   | Analytical workloads, MPP           | Transactional workloads             |

---

## How do you secure Aurora/DynamoDB?

**Aurora Security:**  
- VPC isolation with security groups  
- Encryption at rest (KMS) and in transit (SSL/TLS)  
- IAM database authentication  
- Network ACLs and private subnets  
- Audit logging with AWS CloudTrail and enhanced monitoring  

**DynamoDB Security:**  
- IAM policies for granular access control  
- Encryption at rest with AWS KMS  
- TLS encryption for data in transit  
- VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) for private access  
- Fine-grained access control with condition keys  

---

## How do Global Tables work in DynamoDB?

- Global Tables replicate DynamoDB tables automatically across multiple AWS regions.  
- They provide multi-region, fully active database with low-latency reads and writes in each region.  
- Use **multi-master replication** to synchronize data between regions with eventual consistency.  
- Helps build globally distributed applications for disaster recovery and latency reduction.  
- Conflict resolution handled via "last writer wins" on timestamp or version attribute.

### üìä Why Choose PostgreSQL Over MySQL for Analytics Use Cases?

| Capability                  | PostgreSQL                          | MySQL                             |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Advanced SQL**           | ‚úÖ (Window functions, CTEs, etc.)   | ‚ùå (Limited support)              |
| **JSON/JSONB**             | ‚úÖ Full support with indexing       | Basic JSON functions              |
| **GIS / Spatial Data**     | ‚úÖ PostGIS extension                | Limited spatial support           |
| **Parallel Query**         | ‚úÖ (in newer versions)              | ‚ùå                                |
| **Extensibility**          | ‚úÖ Rich plugin support              | Limited                          |

**Conclusion**: PostgreSQL is more suited for analytical workloads due to richer SQL features, extensibility, and strong support for complex data types.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How Does Aurora Serverless v2 Work Under the Hood?

- **Compute Scaling**: Aurora Serverless v2 uses *warm pooling* of resources and can scale in fine-grained increments (0.5 ACU).
- **Architecture**: Separates storage (shared cluster) from compute nodes. The system monitors workload and adjusts capacity in seconds.
- **Instant Pause/Resume**: Eliminated in v2; the DB stays ‚Äúwarm‚Äù and instantly available.
- **Multi-AZ + High Availability**: Supports automatic failover and HA features of provisioned Aurora.

**Benefits**: Granular autoscaling, no cold start, multi-AZ, cost-efficient for variable workloads.

### üßæ What Are the Licensing Implications of Choosing Oracle or SQL Server?

| Database     | Licensing Type       | Notes                                                                |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Oracle**   | BYOL or License Included | Costly. RAC, Data Guard, and certain features need additional licensing. |
| **SQL Server** | BYOL or License Included | Enterprise edition required for Always On, TDE, etc.                 |

- **BYOL (Bring Your Own License)**: Use your own enterprise license.
- **License Included**: Pay hourly (bundled with RDS cost).

**Tip**: License costs can significantly increase TCO‚Äîconsider Aurora or PostgreSQL for similar capabilities without licensing complexity.

### üîÅ How to Achieve HA with RDS Oracle vs Aurora?

| Feature               | RDS Oracle                            | Aurora                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **HA Setup**          | Multi-AZ with Data Guard or RAC (costly) | Built-in Multi-AZ clusters   |
| **Failover Time**     | 1‚Äì2 minutes (manual config needed)     | Typically <30 seconds        |
| **Backup & Restore**  | Snapshots, Oracle RMAN                | Snapshots, Point-in-Time     |
| **Global DB**         | ‚ùå (manual setup)                      | ‚úÖ Aurora Global DB           |

**Conclusion**: Aurora provides easier, cost-effective HA with faster failover and multi-region replication support.
