## 🔹 1. Amazon CloudWatch

### ✅ Purpose
Monitor metrics, logs, and events across AWS services and applications.

### ✅ Key Components

| Component                  | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Metrics**               | Numeric time-series data (e.g., `CPUUtilization`, `Memory`)                |
| **Logs**                  | Aggregated logs from EC2, Lambda, VPC Flow Logs, etc.                       |
| **Dashboards**            | Custom visualizations (graphs, widgets)                                     |
| **Alarms**                | Threshold-based alerts; trigger actions (SNS, Auto Scaling, etc.)           |
| **Events / Rules**        | Respond to AWS resource state changes using EventBridge (formerly CW Events)|
| **CloudWatch Agent**      | Collects OS-level metrics/logs from EC2 and on-prem hosts                   |
| **Embedded Metrics Format** | Log-based structured custom metrics (EMF)                                  |

### ✅ Interview Focus

- CloudWatch **does not automatically** collect **memory/disk** metrics → Install **CloudWatch Agent**
- Logs can be **retained, filtered, streamed** to S3, Lambda, etc.
- Combine **Alarms + Auto Scaling** for resilient applications
- **Integrate with CloudTrail** to correlate metrics with user/API activity

## 🔹 2. AWS X-Ray

### ✅ Purpose
Distributed tracing system for analyzing **end-to-end latency**, bottlenecks, and errors in **microservices-based** applications.

### ✅ Features

| Feature         | Description                                                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Traces**      | Visualizes full request flow across microservices                  |
| **Segments/Subsegments** | Detailed timing for components (e.g., Lambda, DB, external APIs) |
| **Annotations** | Indexed metadata to filter traces                                  |
| **Sampling**    | Reduce cost by capturing a percentage of requests                  |
| **SDK Support** | SDKs available for Node.js, Java, Python, .NET, Go, etc.           |

### ✅ Interview Focus

- Supports tracing for **Lambda, ECS, EC2, API Gateway, App Mesh**
- Critical for **microservices** observability (latency/error analysis)
- Can **integrate with CloudWatch & ServiceLens**

---

## 🔹 3. AWS CloudTrail

### ✅ Purpose
Track **API activity** across AWS for governance, **auditing**, and **compliance**.

### ✅ Features

| Feature            | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Management Events** | High-level API actions (e.g., EC2 start, S3 bucket policy change)        |
| **Data Events**        | Fine-grained events (e.g., S3 object access, Lambda invocation)         |
| **Event History**      | View last 90 days of events in the console (no setup required)          |
| **Trails**             | Deliver logs to S3, supports multi-region and global configuration      |
| **Integration**        | Send logs to CloudWatch, trigger SNS, Lambda for alerting workflows     |

### ✅ Interview Focus

- **Auditing tool** → not meant for real-time monitoring
- **Data Events** (like S3 object-level access) are **disabled by default** and **charged**
- Use **CloudTrail Lake** to query logs with SQL

---

## 🔹 4. AWS Config

### ✅ Purpose
Continuously **track resource configuration** over time and **enforce compliance** using rules.

### ✅ Features

| Feature              | Description                                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Recorder** | Monitors changes in supported AWS resources                      |
| **Snapshots**         | Point-in-time configuration states                               |
| **Rules**             | Predefined or custom compliance rules (e.g., encryption, tags)   |
| **Remediation**       | Automatically fix non-compliant resources using SSM Automation   |
| **Aggregator**        | View Config data across accounts and regions                     |

### ✅ Interview Focus

- Use to enforce **best practices** (e.g., public S3 block, EC2 tag enforcement)
- Not real-time – **evaluations run periodically**
- Integrates with **Security Hub**, **SNS**, and **CloudWatch**

# 🔍 AWS Observability & Compliance – Common Scenarios & Solutions

---

## 1. How do **CloudWatch** and **X-Ray** complement each other?

- **CloudWatch** provides **metrics, logs, alarms**, and **dashboards** to monitor **performance** and **health**.
- **X-Ray** provides **distributed tracing**, allowing you to analyze **latency**, **errors**, and **request flow** across microservices.
- **Together**:
  - Use **CloudWatch Alarms** to detect high error rates or latency.
  - Drill into **X-Ray traces** from CloudWatch Logs to diagnose **root causes**.

> 📌 Example: An API Gateway alarm triggers due to 5XX errors → use X-Ray to trace where in the backend (Lambda, DB) the failure occurs.

---

## 2. What’s the difference between **CloudTrail** and **AWS Config**?

| Feature          | **CloudTrail**                                  | **AWS Config**                                       |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose          | Track **API activity** (who did what & when)     | Track **resource configuration changes** over time   |
| Data Granularity | Event-based (specific API call per service)      | State-based (snapshots of resource properties)       |
| Use Case         | **Audit**, investigation, forensic analysis      | **Compliance**, policy enforcement, drift detection  |
| Real-Time        | ❌ Near real-time                                 | ❌ Evaluates on schedule or triggers                  |
| Retention        | Delivered to **S3**, queryable with Lake         | Aggregated across **accounts/regions**               |

---

## 3. How can you get notified if an **S3 bucket becomes public**?

✅ **Solution using AWS Config + CloudWatch + SNS**

1. Enable **AWS Config Rule**: `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited` or `s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited`
2. Configure **SNS topic** to receive alerts.
3. Create **CloudWatch Alarm** on Config compliance changes → trigger **SNS notification**.

> 📢 You’ll be alerted any time a bucket becomes non-compliant due to public access.

---

## 4. Can you detect **unauthorized API calls** using AWS services?

✅ Yes, using **CloudTrail + CloudWatch Logs Insights + GuardDuty**

- **CloudTrail** logs all API calls including failed attempts (e.g., `AccessDenied`, `UnauthorizedOperation`)
- Stream **CloudTrail logs** to **CloudWatch Logs**, then create:
  - **Metric filters** for `AccessDenied` events
  - **Alarms** on suspicious API usage patterns
- **GuardDuty** adds threat intelligence and flags anomalous behavior

> 🛡️ Example: Alert when someone attempts to `DeleteTrail` or `PutBucketAcl` without permissions.

---

## 5. How would you trace a **failing Lambda call** across microservices?

✅ Use **AWS X-Ray** for end-to-end tracing

1. Enable **X-Ray tracing** for:
   - API Gateway
   - Lambda functions
   - Upstream services (e.g., App Mesh, ECS)
2. View **trace maps** in the X-Ray console:
   - Visualizes the full request flow
   - Highlights segments with high latency or faults

> 🔍 Helps pinpoint if the issue is in Lambda, a downstream DB call, or another microservice.

---

## 6. How would you enforce that all **EC2s are tagged** with `env`?

✅ Use **AWS Config Rule** + Auto Remediation

1. Enable managed rule: `required-tags`
   - Specify key: `env`
2. Mark resources non-compliant if tag is missing
3. Optionally, use **SSM Automation** for **remediation**:
   - Auto-terminate, quarantine, or notify
4. Use **CloudWatch Alarms** or **AWS Config Aggregator** for visibility

> 🎯 Enforces organizational tagging standards for cost tracking and automation.
