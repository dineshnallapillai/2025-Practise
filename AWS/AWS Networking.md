# Networking in AWS: VPC Fundamentals

Networking is the backbone of your cloud infrastructure. A strong grasp of **VPC, subnets, route tables, gateways, NACLs, SGs**, etc., is mandatory for architecting secure, performant, and scalable systems.

---

## ✅ 1. What is a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)?

A VPC is your isolated network space within AWS where you launch and manage your cloud resources (like EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc.).

You define the IP address range, subnets, routing, security, NAT, firewalls, etc.

Think of it as your own data center in the cloud, completely customizable.

## ✅ 2. Key Components of VPC

| Component           | Description                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **CIDR Block**       | IP address range (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) for the VPC          |
| **Subnets**          | Split the VPC into smaller networks (public or private)   |
| **Route Tables**     | Control traffic flow between subnets and to the internet  |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Allows public subnet traffic to access the internet |
| **NAT Gateway**      | Allows private subnet traffic to initiate internet connections |
| **Security Groups (SG)** | Stateful virtual firewalls for EC2 (at instance level) |
| **Network ACLs (NACLs)** | Stateless firewalls at the subnet level                 |
| **VPC Peering**      | Connect two VPCs (same/different accounts) privately      |
| **Transit Gateway**  | Scalable way to connect many VPCs and on-premises networks|
| **Endpoints**        | Private access to AWS services (via PrivateLink or Gateway) |

---

## ✅ 3. Public vs Private Subnet

| Subnet Type | Internet Access      | Typical Use                |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **Public**  | Has route to IGW    | Web servers, Bastion hosts  |
| **Private** | No direct route to IGW | App servers, DBs, internal APIs |

*Subnets are public when they are associated with a route table that has a route to the Internet Gateway.*

---

## ✅ 4. Internet Access in VPC

To make EC2 publicly accessible:

- Attach Internet Gateway (IGW) to VPC  
- Add route in subnet’s Route Table to `0.0.0.0/0 → IGW`  
- Ensure EC2 has public IP and SG allows inbound traffic  

---

## ✅ 5. NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance

| Feature      | NAT Gateway             | NAT Instance           |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Managed?     | ✅ Fully managed by AWS | ❌ You manage it       |
| HA?          | ✅ in AZ                | ❌ Single instance     |
| Bandwidth    | High                   | Limited               |
| Cost         | More expensive         | Cheaper               |
| Use Case     | Production             | Dev/Test only         |

---

## ✅ 6. Security Group vs NACL

| Feature     | Security Group          | NACL                   |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Stateful?   | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                  |
| Applies to  | Instances              | Subnets                |
| Rules Type  | Allow only             | Allow + Deny           |
| Rule Order  | All rules evaluated    | Rules evaluated in order (numbered) |

---

## ✅ 7. VPC Peering vs Transit Gateway

| Feature     | VPC Peering            | Transit Gateway        |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Type        | Point-to-point         | Hub-and-spoke          |
| Cost        | Lower                  | Higher                 |
| Scalability | Harder with many VPCs  | Easier                 |
| Use Case    | Simple setups (2-3 VPCs) | Large orgs (10+ VPCs, multi-account) |

---

## ✅ 8. VPC Endpoints

Let you privately connect to AWS services without going over the public internet.

| Type               | Description                                | Example                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Interface Endpoint | ENI for services like SSM, SNS, Lambda, etc. | `com.amazonaws.region.s3`     |
| Gateway Endpoint   | For S3 and DynamoDB only                   | Route traffic via route tables |

---

## ✅ 9. Routing in VPC

Routing is done via route tables, one per subnet.

### Sample Route Table (Public Subnet):

| Destination  | Target    |
|--------------|-----------|
| 10.0.0.0/16  | local     |
| 0.0.0.0/0    | igw-xyz   |

### Sample Route Table (Private Subnet):

| Destination  | Target     |
|--------------|------------|
| 10.0.0.0/16  | local      |
| 0.0.0.0/0    | nat-gw-abc |

---

## ✅ 10. VPC Design Best Practices

- Use multi-AZ setup for high availability (HA)  
- Isolate resources in private subnets  
- Use NAT Gateway for internet access from private subnets  
- Add VPC Flow Logs for network-level monitoring  
- Use Security Groups (SGs) + NACLs wisely; don't rely only on SGs for perimeter security  
- Avoid overlapping CIDR blocks across VPCs  
- Use AWS Firewall Manager and Network Firewall for advanced control

---

# Whitepaper Insights (VPC Best Practices)

- **Design your network to scale across accounts using AWS Organizations, and adopt Transit Gateway to simplify hub-and-spoke connectivity.**

- **Keep private subnets for sensitive resources. Never attach public IPs unnecessarily.**

---

# 1. VPC Peering

➤ **What is it?**  
Private connection between two VPCs, using AWS's internal network.  
Can be in the same or different regions (inter-region peering supported).  
Traffic does not traverse the internet.

➤ **Key Points:**

| Property        | Details                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| Connection Type | One-to-one (point-to-point)     |
| Region Support  | Intra-region and inter-region   |
| Routing         | Requires manual route table entries |
| Transitive?     | ❌ No (A ↔ B, B ↔ C ≠ A ↔ C)     |

➤ **Use Case:**  
Two VPCs (same account or cross-account) need private access to each other.

➤ **Limitations:**  
- No transitive routing.  
- Can become complex with many VPCs.

---

# 2. AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)

➤ **What is it?**  
A highly scalable hub-and-spoke model for interconnecting multiple VPCs and VPNs.  
Replaces complex VPC peering meshes.

➤ **Key Points:**

| Property         | Details                          |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Routing          | Centralized in the TGW           |
| Transitive Routing | ✅ Yes                        |
| Scalability      | Thousands of VPCs                |
| Pricing          | Charged per attachment + data transferred |

➤ **Use Case:**  
Large organizations with multi-VPC, multi-account architecture.  
Want to centralize control and simplify routing.

---

# 3. AWS Direct Connect

➤ **What is it?**  
A dedicated private network connection between your on-premises data center and AWS.

➤ **Key Benefits:**

| Property          | Details                         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Private Connectivity | Bypasses the public internet  |
| Lower Latency & Jitter | Predictable performance     |
| Higher Bandwidth   | Up to 100 Gbps                  |
| Secure            | Never leaves the private circuit |

➤ **Use Case:**  
Financial institutions, healthcare, or large enterprises with strict security/compliance and data-heavy transfers.

➤ **Setup:**  
- Connect your router to an AWS Direct Connect location.  
- Establish a virtual interface (VIF) to a VPC or Transit Gateway.

---

# 4. AWS Site-to-Site VPN

➤ **What is it?**  
A secure IPSec tunnel over the public internet from your on-premises network to AWS VPC.

➤ **Key Points:**

| Property     | Details                           |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Tunnels      | 2 per VPN connection for redundancy |
| Availability | 99.9% SLA                        |

| Throughput   | ~1.25 Gbps max per tunnel (can vary) |

➤ **Use Case:**  
Quick, cost-effective way to connect to AWS from on-prem.  
Often used with Direct Connect for redundancy (VPN backup path).

---

# 5. AWS PrivateLink (Interface Endpoints)

➤ **What is it?**  
Allows you to access AWS services or your own services privately over AWS’s internal network using VPC Interface Endpoints.  
With PrivateLink, traffic never leaves the Amazon network.  
Unlike NAT Gateway → doesn’t go to the internet.

➤ **Key Benefits:**

| Property          | Details                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Security          | No public internet               |
| Simple            | No need for IGW, NAT, etc.       |
| Private Hosted Zone | Supported                     |
| Supports          | S3, SNS, Lambda, KMS, Secrets Manager, etc. |

➤ **Use Case:**  
A SaaS provider can expose their service to customers securely.  
Internal teams can access a service (like an internal API) without IGW/NAT.

# Difference Between a Security Group and a Network Access Control List (NACL)

Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are fundamental networking security features in AWS VPC, but they operate at different layers and have distinct characteristics:

| Feature              | Security Group (SG)                      | Network Access Control List (NACL)            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Layer of Operation    | Instance Level (Layer 4 - Transport)   | Subnet Level (Layer 3 - Network)               |
| Statefulness         | Stateful                               | Stateless                                     |
| Rules                | Allow only (implicitly denies all else)| Allow and Deny                                |
| Order of Evaluation   | All rules evaluated, Allow is permissive| Rules evaluated in order by rule number       |
| Default Action       | Implicitly denies all inbound, allows all outbound | Explicitly denies all inbound and outbound unless allowed |
| Association          | Attached to EC2 instances (or ENIs)    | Attached to subnets                           |
| Scope                | Controls traffic to/from a single instance | Controls traffic to/from all instances in a subnet |
| Max Rules            | ~60 (soft limit, can be increased)     | 200 (hard limit)                              |
| Use Case             | Fine-grained instance protection, application layer | Broad subnet-level filtering, first line of defense |

---

## Key Differences Explained:

### Layer of Operation (Granularity):

- **Security Groups:** Operate at the instance level. Attached to EC2 instances or Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs), controlling traffic directly to/from those specific instances.

- **NACLs:** Operate at the subnet level. Attached to a subnet and apply rules to all traffic entering or leaving any instance within the subnet.

### Statefulness:

- **Security Groups (Stateful):** If you allow inbound traffic (e.g., HTTP port 80), the response traffic is automatically allowed outbound, and vice versa, simplifying rule management.

- **NACLs (Stateless):** Must explicitly allow both inbound and outbound traffic. Allowing inbound traffic requires allowing the outbound response explicitly.

### Rules and Default Action:

- **Security Groups:** Only have allow rules; anything not allowed is implicitly denied. The default security group allows all outbound and denies all inbound traffic.

- **NACLs:** Support both allow and deny rules. The default NACL allows all traffic. Custom NACLs deny all inbound and outbound traffic until rules are added.

### Order of Evaluation:

- **Security Groups:** All rules are evaluated, and if any rule allows the traffic, it is permitted.

- **NACLs:** Rules are evaluated in numerical order. The first matching rule applies immediately. Common practice is to leave gaps (e.g., 100, 200, 300) for rule insertion. The default last rule denies all.

---

## When to Use Which:

- **Security Groups:** Primary tool for instance-level security. Use for fine-grained control over allowed protocols and applications per instance.

- **NACLs:** Secondary layer of defense for broad, coarse subnet-level filtering. Useful for blocking known malicious IPs or enforcing subnet segmentation.

Typically, both are used together for a layered security approach (defense in depth).

---

# How to Make a Private EC2 Instance Access the Internet Securely

A *private* EC2 instance is launched into a private subnet (no public IP, no direct route to Internet Gateway). To allow outbound internet access (e.g., for updates) **without exposing it to inbound internet traffic**, use a NAT Gateway.

### Setup:

- **VPC Structure:**
  - **Public Subnet:** Has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW). Hosts the NAT Gateway.
  - **Private Subnet:** No direct IGW route. Hosts the private EC2 instance.

- **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Attached to the VPC, enabling internet communication.

- **NAT Gateway:**
  - Deployed in the public subnet.
  - Has an Elastic IP.
  - Allows private subnet instances to initiate internet traffic while blocking inbound initiated connections.

- **Route Tables:**
  - **Public Subnet Route Table:**
    - Local VPC CIDR route.
    - Default route (0.0.0.0/0) → Internet Gateway.
  - **Private Subnet Route Table:**
    - Local VPC CIDR route.
    - Default route (0.0.0.0/0) → NAT Gateway.

- **Security Groups:**
  - EC2 instance: Allow only necessary inbound traffic (e.g., SSH from bastion), typically allow all outbound.
  - NAT Gateway: Allow inbound from private subnet CIDR and outbound to internet.

### How it Works:

1. Private instance sends traffic destined to internet.
2. Private subnet routes it to NAT Gateway.
3. NAT Gateway replaces the instance's private IP with its Elastic IP and forwards to IGW.
4. Response from internet is routed back through NAT Gateway to the private instance.

This setup enables secure internet access for private instances while preventing unsolicited inbound internet traffic.

---

# What Happens if You Don't Attach a Route Table to a Subnet?

- Every subnet **must** have a route table associated.
- If you don’t explicitly associate one, AWS associates the subnet with the **main route table** of the VPC.

### Consequences:

- The subnet inherits all routes from the main route table.
- If the main route table has a route to an IGW (making it "public"), the subnet behaves like a public subnet.
- If the main route table routes only locally or to NAT Gateway (making it "private"), the subnet behaves accordingly.

### Best Practice:

- Explicitly create and associate custom route tables per subnet to:
  - Clearly define routing (public, private, database).
  - Avoid unintended exposure.
  - Reduce human error.

---

# How to Connect VPCs in Different Regions

### 1. VPC Peering Connection

- **Concept:** Private connection between two VPCs (same or different AWS accounts), enabling direct routing between them.
- **Cross-Region:** Supported.
- **Steps:**
  - Initiate peering request.
  - Accept peering request.
  - Manually update route tables on both sides.
  - Ensure security groups and NACLs allow traffic.
- **Limitations:**
  - Non-transitive: A ↔ B, B ↔ C ≠ A ↔ C.
  - No overlapping CIDRs allowed.

### 2. AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)

- **Concept:** Centralized network transit hub interconnecting VPCs and on-premises networks.
- **Cross-Region:** Supports peering between TGWs in different regions.
- **Steps:**
  - Create TGWs in each region.
  - Attach VPCs to respective TGWs.
  - Create peering attachment between TGWs.
  - Update TGW route tables for cross-region routing.
  - Update VPC route tables to use TGW.
- **Advantages:**
  - Transitive routing.
  - Centralized management.
  - Scalable for many VPCs.
  - No CIDR overlap restriction within TGW.

# When to Use a Transit Gateway Over VPC Peering

Use Transit Gateway when:

- You have many VPCs requiring N-to-N connectivity.
- You want simplified management with a central hub.
- You need cross-region connectivity at scale.
- You want to connect on-premises networks to multiple VPCs via a single point.
- You require transitive routing between VPCs.
- You want network segmentation and fine-grained security policies.
- You have shared services VPCs accessed by many others.

# AWS Networking Q&A

### What's the difference between VPC Peering and Transit Gateway?

| Feature                   | VPC Peering                                   | Transit Gateway                                     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Connection Type**       | Direct 1:1 connection between two VPCs       | Central hub connecting many VPCs and on-premises   |
| **Scalability**           | Limited, requires many peering connections for multiple VPCs (N*(N-1)/2) | Highly scalable with centralized management        |
| **Routing**               | Non-transitive (no traffic forwarding between peerings) | Transitive routing between all attached VPCs       |
| **Cross-Region Support**  | Supports cross-region peering                 | Supports peering between Transit Gateways across regions |
| **Management Complexity** | High with many VPCs (manual route updates)   | Simplified with centralized route tables           |
| **Cost**                  | Lower for simple 1:1 connections              | Higher but operationally efficient for complex setups |
| **Use Case**              | Small number of VPCs, simple direct communication | Large-scale, multi-VPC, hybrid cloud, and on-premises networks |

---

### How do you connect two VPCs across accounts?

- **Use VPC Peering:**
  - Create a peering connection request from one VPC owner to the other account’s VPC.
  - The other account accepts the peering request.
  - Update route tables in both VPCs to route traffic via the peering connection.
  - Configure security groups and NACLs to allow desired traffic.

- **Alternatively, use Transit Gateway (if multiple VPCs):**
  - Share or accept Transit Gateway attachments between accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM).
  - Attach VPCs from different accounts to the same Transit Gateway.
  - Manage routing centrally on the Transit Gateway.

---

### Can you access a PrivateLink endpoint from outside AWS?

- **No.**  
PrivateLink endpoints are designed to provide private connectivity **within** AWS. They allow secure, private access to services inside VPCs without exposing them to the public internet.

- To access PrivateLink services **outside AWS**, you must connect to the AWS network first (e.g., via VPN or AWS Direct Connect).

---

### What is the benefit of using Direct Connect over VPN?

| Feature              | AWS Direct Connect                         | VPN (Internet-based)                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Connection Type**   | Dedicated, private network connection     | Encrypted connection over the public internet |
| **Bandwidth**         | Higher and more consistent (1 Gbps to 100 Gbps+) | Limited and variable, dependent on internet |
| **Latency**           | Lower and more stable                      | Higher and less predictable                 |
| **Security**          | Private connection without internet exposure | Encrypted but traverses public internet     |
| **Reliability**       | Higher SLA and more reliable               | Dependent on internet quality                |
| **Cost**              | Higher fixed cost, lower variable cost    | Usually lower upfront cost                   |
| **Use Case**          | Enterprise-grade hybrid connectivity, large data transfer, latency-sensitive apps | Quick setup, lower throughput, less sensitive apps |

### How would you expose an internal service securely to another VPC?

- **Use AWS PrivateLink (Interface VPC Endpoint):**
  - Create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in the service VPC exposing the internal service.
  - Create a PrivateLink endpoint service pointing to the NLB.
  - In the consumer VPC, create an Interface Endpoint connecting to that PrivateLink service.
  - This allows secure, private connectivity to the service **without traversing the public internet**.

- **Alternatives:**
  - Use **VPC Peering** or **Transit Gateway** and restrict access via security groups and NACLs.
  - Use a **VPN** or **Direct Connect** if cross-account or on-premises connectivity is needed.
  - Use **API Gateway with VPC Link** if exposing HTTP-based services securely.
