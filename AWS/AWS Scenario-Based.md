# AWS Architecture Patterns – Part 3 (76–90)

---

## 76. Design a fully serverless web application architecture  
✅ **Solution:**  
### Frontend:  
- Amazon S3 for static hosting  
- CloudFront for CDN  

### Backend API:  
- Amazon API Gateway + AWS Lambda  
- Amazon Cognito for Auth  

### Database:  
- DynamoDB with on-demand capacity  

### Messaging:  
- SNS for email/SMS  
- SQS for decoupling async tasks  

### Monitoring:  
- CloudWatch Logs + X-Ray  

### Deployment:  
- CloudFormation / CDK / SAM  

---

## 77. Deploy a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized application on ECS  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Use CodePipeline  
  - **Source:** CodeCommit or GitHub  
  - **Build:** CodeBuild (build Docker image, push to ECR)  
  - **Deploy:** ECS Blue/Green via CodeDeploy  
- Use CloudWatch Events to trigger pipeline  
- Use IAM roles with least privilege  
- Store build artifacts in S3  

---

## 78. Design a cost-effective backend with unpredictable workloads  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Use AWS Lambda (scales to zero, per-request pricing)  
- API Gateway or ALB (Lambda Target) as entry  
- Use S3 + DynamoDB (on-demand)  
- Archive logs to S3 IA or Glacier Deep Archive  

---

## 79. Containerized microservices: what orchestration engine to choose?  
✅ **Solution:**  

| Engine        | Use When...                                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ECS Fargate   | Serverless containers, minimal ops          |
| ECS EC2       | Need GPU, full control of EC2               |
| EKS (K8s)     | Need K8s ecosystem, Helm, advanced features |
| App Runner    | Simplified web apps, fast Git/ECR deploy    |
| Batch         | Long-running / batch workloads              |

---

## 80. Migrate a monolith to serverless gradually  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Use Strangler Fig Pattern  
- Front monolith with API Gateway  
- Redirect individual routes to Lambda  
- Extract services incrementally (auth, payment, etc.)  
- Store new data in DynamoDB  
- Use RDS Proxy for legacy DB  
- Monitor with CloudWatch + X-Ray  

---

## 81. Automate serverless app deployment with approvals  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Use CodePipeline  
  - **Source:** GitHub / CodeCommit  
  - **Build:** CodeBuild with SAM or CloudFormation  
  - **Approval:** Manual Approval step  
  - **Deploy:** Lambda + API Gateway  
- Use Parameter Store / Secrets Manager  
- Notify via SNS → Slack or Email  

---

## 82. Your Lambda functions are hitting concurrency limits. What to do?  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Monitor CloudWatch Metrics for Throttles  
- Increase Reserved or Account concurrency  
- Use SQS + Lambda for spiky loads  
- Use Provisioned Concurrency for latency-sensitive  
- Optimize code: reduce cold starts, shorten duration  

---

## 83. Optimize S3 cost for infrequently accessed data  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering  
- For known patterns, use S3 Standard-IA  
- Enable Lifecycle Policies → Glacier / Glacier Deep Archive  
- Avoid Glacier Deep Archive for latency-sensitive data  

---

## 84. Secure a containerized app with sensitive APIs  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Run ECS in private subnets  
- ALB with HTTPS termination  
- Auth via Cognito or OIDC  
- Encrypt env vars with Secrets Manager  
- Use strict IAM Task Roles  
- Enable Container Insights + GuardDuty  

---

## 85. Implement cost controls in a shared dev environment  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Use separate accounts via AWS Organizations  
- Apply SCPs (deny GPU EC2, etc.)  
- Set Budgets & Alarms  
- Auto-stop EC2/RDS via Lambda Scheduler  
- Use tags → analyze with Cost Explorer  

---

## 86. How to containerize a legacy Java application  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Use Amazon Corretto or OpenJDK in Dockerfile  
- Build via CodeBuild → Push to Amazon ECR  
- Deploy using:  
  - ECS Fargate (simple)  
  - EKS (if K8s is standard)  
- Add sidecars (Fluent Bit) for logs/metrics  

---

## 87. Machine learning on large video datasets using containers  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Store video in S3  
- Preprocess using ECS/EKS with GPU  
- Use SageMaker Processing (custom container)  
- Split jobs via SQS + Lambda Orchestrator  
- Output results to S3 or DynamoDB  

---

## 88. How to do Blue-Green deployments in ECS  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Use CodeDeploy with ECS deployment type  
- Two task sets behind same ALB target group  
- Shift traffic gradually or all-at-once  
- Auto rollback on health check failure  
- Monitor with CloudWatch Alarms + Events  

---

## 89. Design a SaaS backend using containers with tenant isolation  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Use per-tenant: ECS task / Fargate service / EKS namespace  
- Auth via Cognito + Custom Authorizers  
- ALB path-based routing or API Gateway  
- Store metadata in DynamoDB (partitioned per tenant)  

---

## 90. Best practices to reduce AWS Lambda cost  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Tune memory via AWS Lambda Power Tuning  
- Avoid long-running functions → use SQS batching  
- Use async invocation with DLQs  
- Use Lambda@Edge for early compute  
- Use Provisioned Concurrency only when needed  
- Limit excessive logs (LogLevel filtering)
