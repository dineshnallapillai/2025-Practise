# 📡 AWS Application Integration Services

Application integration services help decouple application components, enabling scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability.

## 1️⃣ Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)

### 🔍 What It Is:
A fully managed **pub/sub messaging** service that enables fan-out architecture.

### 🧠 Concepts:
- **Topic**: Logical access point
- **Publisher**: Sends messages to the topic
- **Subscriber**: Receives messages (via Email, Lambda, HTTP, SQS, etc.)

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Send alerts (email, SMS)
- Fan-out messages to multiple systems
- Notify microservices of events

### 📦 Delivery Options:
- HTTP(S)
- SQS
- Lambda
- Email/SMS
- Mobile push notifications

### 📐 Architecture Example:

[ SNS Topic ]

[SQS] [Email] [Lambda]

## 2️⃣ Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)

### 🔍 What It Is:
A fully managed **message queuing** service for decoupling components.

### 🧠 Types:
- **Standard Queue**: High throughput, at-least-once delivery, possible duplication
- **FIFO Queue**: Exactly-once, ordered delivery

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Decoupling producer-consumer systems
- Background task processing (e.g., image processing)
- Buffering writes to databases or APIs

### 💡 Key Features:
- Visibility timeout
- Dead-letter queues (DLQs)
- Long polling
- Delay queues

## 3️⃣ AWS Step Functions

### 🔍 What It Is:
A serverless **orchestration** service to coordinate multiple AWS services into workflows using **state machines**.

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Multi-step workflows (e.g., order processing, ML pipeline)
- Retry logic and error handling
- Human approval workflows

### 🧠 Concepts:
- **State machine**: JSON-defined flow of states
- **Task**: Performs work (Lambda, ECS, Glue, etc.)
- **Choice**: Branching
- **Parallel**: Concurrent steps
- **Wait**: Delay
- **Fail/Catch**: Error handling

### 📐 Architecture Example:

[Start]
|
[Validate Input]
|
[Choice]
/
[Reject] [Approve]
| |
[End] [Send Email]


### 🛠️ Integrations:
- Lambda
- ECS/EKS
- SQS
- Glue
- SageMaker
- API Gateway

## 4️⃣ Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events)

### 🔍 What It Is:
A serverless **event bus** that allows you to route events from sources to targets.

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Event-driven microservices
- SaaS integration (e.g., Auth0, Zendesk, Okta)
- Decouple producer and consumer services

### 🧠 Concepts:
- **Event source**: AWS service, custom, or SaaS
- **Event bus**: Default / custom
- **Rule**: Filters event pattern → routes to target
- **Target**: Lambda, SQS, Step Functions, SNS, etc.

## 🎯 Interview Q&A

### Q1: How would you decouple a producer and consumer in AWS?
**A:** Use **SQS** to store messages, allowing producers to send without waiting for consumers. Consumers poll and process messages asynchronously.

---

### Q2: Difference between SNS and EventBridge?
**A:** 
- **SNS** is topic-based pub/sub.
- **EventBridge** is content-based routing with support for **third-party** event sources and **schema registry**.

---

### Q3: When to use Step Functions over Lambda chaining?
**A:** When you need:
- Retry logic
- Parallel execution
- Choice branching
- Human approval
Use **Step Functions** for orchestration and better observability.

---

### Q4: FIFO vs Standard Queue?
**A:**
- **FIFO**: Guarantees **exactly-once** and **ordered** delivery.
- **Standard**: **High throughput**, **at-least-once** delivery, **no guaranteed order**.
