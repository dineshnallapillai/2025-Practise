# Docker Images

A Docker Image is a read-only template used to create containers. It includes everything needed to run an application—code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

## 📦 4.1 What is a Docker Image?

- Think of an image as a snapshot of a filesystem.
- It is **immutable** (can’t be changed once created).
- You build it using a **Dockerfile** or pull it from a registry like Docker Hub.

## 🧱 4.2 Image vs Container

| Docker Image            | Docker Container              |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Template/blueprint      | Running instance of an image  |
| Read-only              | Read-write                   |
| Can be versioned       | Ephemeral (can be removed)   |
| Shared among containers | Isolated environment         |

## 🔍 4.3 Inspecting Images

```bash
# List all images
docker images

# Pull an image manually
docker pull nginx

# Remove an image
docker rmi nginx

# Inspect image details
docker inspect nginx

# Tag an image
docker tag nginx myrepo/nginx:v1
```
## 4.4 How Docker Builds Images (Layers)

Every image is made up of layers, each representing a command in the Dockerfile (like `RUN`, `COPY`, etc.).

### ✅ Benefits:
- Layer caching: speeds up builds
- Layer reuse: shared across containers/images

### 📌 Example:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
COPY ./app /app
CMD ["./app/start.sh"]
```
Each line becomes a layer in the image.

## 4.5 Creating an Image from a Container (Quick and Dirty)

This is **NOT** best practice, but useful sometimes.

- Run a container and make changes inside it
- Commit it to an image:

```bash
docker commit <container-id> my-custom-image
```
## 4.6 Try It: Explore and Build Images

```bash
# Pull an image
docker pull alpine

# Run it interactively
docker run -it alpine sh

# Inside container: install something
apk add curl

# Exit container
exit

# Check container ID
docker ps -a

# Commit your changes as a new image
docker commit <container-id> alpine-with-curl

# Run your new image
docker run -it alpine-with-curl sh
```
## 4.7 Pushing to Docker Hub

```bash
# Log in
docker login

# Tag your image
docker tag myapp yourdockerhubusername/myapp:v1

# Push
docker push yourdockerhubusername/myapp:v1
```
Tip: You can also use AWS ECR, Azure ACR, Harbor, etc. for private registries.

## Useful Commands Recap

| Task                      | Command                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| List images               | `docker images`              |
| Pull image                | `docker pull nginx`          |
| Remove image              | `docker rmi nginx`           |
| Commit container to image | `docker commit <cid> name`   |
| Tag image                 | `docker tag img user/repo:tag` |
| Push to Docker Hub        | `docker push user/repo:tag` |

---

## ✅ Summary

- Images are templates used to run containers.
- They are made of layers and can be versioned, tagged, pushed, and pulled.
- You can create images from containers (temporary) or build them properly using a Dockerfile (coming next!).
