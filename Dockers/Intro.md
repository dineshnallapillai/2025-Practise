# 🐳 Introduction to Docker

## 🧠 What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications along with their dependencies and run them consistently across different environments.

> 💡 *"A lightweight, portable, and isolated environment to run your application."*

## 🔍 Why Use Docker?

| Feature                  | Benefit                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🏗️ Environment Consistency | Run the same code everywhere—local, dev, test, prod.                   |
| 📦 Isolation              | Each container has its own filesystem, network, and process space.     |
| 🚀 Portability            | Containers run on any system that supports Docker (Windows, Linux, macOS). |
| 💨 Fast Startup           | Containers start in seconds (compared to VMs).                          |
| 🧰 Microservices-Friendly | Easily break apps into services, each running in its own container.    |
| 💲 Cost-Effective         | Less overhead than full-blown virtual machines.                        |

## 🏗️ Docker vs Virtual Machines

| Feature        | Docker (Containers)       | Virtual Machines            |
|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| OS             | Shares host OS kernel      | Includes full guest OS       |
| Startup        | Seconds                    | Minutes                      |
| Resource Usage | Lightweight                | Heavy                        |
| Isolation      | Process-level              | Full OS-level                |
| Use Case       | Microservices, DevOps, CI/CD | Legacy systems, full isolation |

## 🧱 Key Docker Concepts

1. **Image**  
   - Blueprint of the application (e.g., `.NET 8 Web API + runtime + dependencies`)  
   - Read-only, built from a `Dockerfile`.

2. **Container**  
   - A running instance of an image.  
   - Ephemeral—can be created, destroyed, started, or stopped.

3. **Docker Engine**  
   - Core component installed on your machine (client–daemon architecture).  
   - Responsible for building and running containers.

4. **Docker CLI / Client**  
   - Command-line interface (e.g., `docker run`, `docker ps`)  
   - Communicates with Docker daemon using REST API over Unix socket or TCP.

5. **Docker Daemon**  
   - Background process (`dockerd`) that manages containers and images.

6. **Docker Hub**  
   - Default public image registry.  
   - Use `docker pull nginx` to download and `docker push myimage` to upload images.

## ✅ Summary

- Docker allows you to package your app + dependencies into **images**.
- You run **containers** based on those images.
- Containers are **lightweight, isolated environments**.
- Docker promotes **consistent deployment** across environments.
