# Final Interview Review + Mock Q&A + Leadership (STAR)

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Final Technical Q&A Review

### ‚úÖ .NET

**Q:** What is the difference between `IActionResult` and `ActionResult<T>`?  
**A:** `IActionResult` is a generic return type, while `ActionResult<T>` allows typed return + status code. Use `ActionResult<Product>` for better Swagger/documentation.

**Q:** How do you handle exceptions in .NET Web API?  
**A:** Use `UseExceptionHandler` middleware for global handling. For domain-specific errors, use custom exception filters (`IExceptionFilter`).

---

### ‚úÖ AWS

**Q:** When would you use ECS vs Lambda?  
**A:** ECS is better for long-running APIs or .NET apps. Lambda fits best for short, event-driven tasks like S3 triggers, async queue consumers.

**Q:** How do you secure S3 uploads?  
**A:** Use pre-signed URLs for client-side upload, with bucket policies + encryption (`AES-256` or KMS).

---

### ‚úÖ Microservices

**Q:** What‚Äôs the difference between orchestration and choreography?  
**A:** Orchestration has a central controller (like Step Functions). Choreography is event-based (like EventBridge or Kafka).

**Q:** How do you handle inter-service failures?  
**A:** Use retries (with exponential backoff), circuit breakers (Polly), timeouts, and queues for async flows.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ System Design Rapid Recap

### üí° Common Design Breakdown Template

- Clarify use case
- Estimate scale: RPS, storage, concurrency
- Identify APIs and services
- Use caching, queuing, async processing
- Secure with auth/token rate limits
- Log/trap errors, set up tracing

---

### Example: ‚ÄúDesign a Scalable Notification System‚Äù

**Components**:
- Notification API (accepts user, type, message)
- SQS for async queueing
- Worker service (reads from queue ‚Üí sends SMS/email/push)
- Redis for deduplication
- SNS for fan-out (multiple targets)
- Dashboard for delivery status

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Mock Interview Questions (Technical + Behavioral)

### üîπ Technical

- Design a file upload + virus scanning system.
- How would you build a distributed rate limiter?
- What are the trade-offs of using gRPC vs REST?
- How do you handle schema changes in NoSQL?
- Explain how you would containerize and deploy a .NET 8 microservice.

---

### üîπ Behavioral

- Tell me about a time you disagreed on architecture.
- How do you mentor a junior team member struggling with async programming?
- Describe a system outage and how you handled it.
- How do you deal with scope creep in sprint planning?
- Walk me through a time when you had to influence without authority.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ How to Answer Like a Staff Engineer

‚úÖ Speak in **layers** (client ‚Üí gateway ‚Üí service ‚Üí DB)  
‚úÖ Always mention **scale, security, observability**  
‚úÖ Discuss **trade-offs** ("I chose Redis over Memcached because of...")  
‚úÖ Use phrases like:
- ‚ÄúFrom an architectural standpoint...‚Äù
- ‚ÄúFor operational resilience...‚Äù
- ‚ÄúTo reduce blast radius, we...‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWe prioritized observability by adding X-Ray + correlation IDs.‚Äù
