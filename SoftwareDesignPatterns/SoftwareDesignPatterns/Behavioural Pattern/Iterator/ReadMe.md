# Iterator Pattern

The **Iterator Pattern** provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing  
its underlying representation.

## Example Analogy: TV Remote

Think of a TV remote that lets you flip through channels one at a time.  
You don’t know how the channels are stored — you just use Next/Previous.

## Intent

- Traverse elements in a collection without revealing the internal structure.
- Provide a standardized way to iterate over collections.
- Supports multiple traversals at the same time.
