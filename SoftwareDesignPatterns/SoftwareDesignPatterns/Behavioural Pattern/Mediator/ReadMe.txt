The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral pattern that centralizes communication between objects (called colleagues) 
so they don't communicate with each other directly.This reduces coupling and improves code maintainability

Think of a mediator as a control tower at an airport — planes don’t talk to each other; they talk to the tower, 
and the tower coordinates.
