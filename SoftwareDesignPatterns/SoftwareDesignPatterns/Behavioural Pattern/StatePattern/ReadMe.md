# State Pattern

The **State Pattern** allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.  
The object will appear to change its class at runtime.

## When to Use

- When an object's behavior depends on its state and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state.
- Avoiding large switch/case or if-else blocks for state-specific logic.
