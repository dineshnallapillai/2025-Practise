# Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on object creation, abstracting the instantiation process to  
make it more flexible and decoupled. They ensure that objects are created in a manner appropriate  
to the context without specifying the exact class of the object.

## Patterns

- Singleton  
- Factory Method  
- Abstract Factory  
- Builder  
- Prototype
