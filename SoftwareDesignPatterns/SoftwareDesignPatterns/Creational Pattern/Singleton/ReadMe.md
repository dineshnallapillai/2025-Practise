# Singleton Pattern

Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global access point to it.

## Problem It Solves

You want to ensure that a class (like Logger, Configuration, or DatabaseConnection) has exactly one instance in the system, and that instance is easily accessible globally.

## When to Use

- Centralized logging  
- App-wide configuration  
- Shared cache or service state  
- Licensing service, audit logger, etc.
